# Welcome to My GitHub Page, Quote on My Work:

My work carries my spirit, before it carries a message. My intuition plays a vital role in the direction I go and then I compartmentalise with what I prioritise. I represent different parts of myself including abstraction, curiosity, mythology, spirituality and introspection.

## Blackness in My Work

Blackness is vital in my work because it is created by a black woman despite the medium or language it speaks, it is vital because proof of existence is rare in the black community, information is shared but isnâ€™t sustained in ways that are knowledgeable to us right now. 

## Expression and Clarity

I express my yearning for answers and clarity in ways that make my blackness clear even when the work is abstract. My practice embodies subtlety in a form of texture and expression, a curious mix of ambiguity and curiosity. 

## Experimentation

I experiment with different textures and moulds that are formed from the earth.
